# Assignment: Book Database API

# Introduction:
  This assignment involves creating a RESTful API for managing a simple book database.
  The API will allow clients to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)
  operations on book records.
  
# Objective:
  Task is to develop an API with endpoints that facilitate the management of a
  collection of books. Each book record should contain the following fields:
  ● Title
  ● Author
  ● ISBN
  ● Publication Date
  
# Technical Requirements:
# CRUD Operations:
  ● Implement an endpoint to create a new book entry.
  ● Implement an endpoint to read or retrieve book entries.
  ● Implement an endpoint to update an existing book entry.
  ● Implement an endpoint to delete a book entry.
  
# Data Validation:
  ● Ensure all book entries have a title, author, ISBN, and publication date.
  ● Validate incoming data for correct data types and the presence of required
    fields.
